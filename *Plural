We need a simple function that determines if a plural is needed or not. It should take a number, 
and return true if a plural should be used with that number or false if not. 
This would be useful when printing out a string such as 5 minutes, 14 apples, or 1 sun.


function plural(n) {
  if (n === 0 || n === 1) return !n;
  return !!n;
}
