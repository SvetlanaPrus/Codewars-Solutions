Coding in function cutCube. function accept 2 parameter: volume and n. 
volume is the volume of a cube. If we cut the cube into n block. please determine whether the length of the cube is an integer. return true or false.

For exmaple:

volume=27, it can be divided into 27 blocks, each small cube side length is 1
cutCube(27,27) should return true

volume=512, it can be divided into 8 blocks, each small cube side length is 4
cutCube(512,8) should return true

volume=512, it can be divided into 64 blocks, each small cube side length is 2
cutCube(512,64) should return true

If the side length of small cube is not a integer, should return false.
cutCube(256,8) should return false
cutCube(27,3) should return false
cutCube(123,456) should return false

If it can't be divided evenly into n small cubes, should return false too.
cutCube(50000,50) should return false
cutCube(256,4) should return false

The two examples above seems to meet our requirements, but please note: a cube is unable to evenly divided into 50 pieces or 4 pieces. 
Only cubic numbers(such as 8,27,64,125,216...) can be used to divide the cube evenly.


*******************************************************

function cutCube(volume,n){
  return Math.round(Math.cbrt(volume/n)) ** 3 === volume/n && Math.round(Math.cbrt(n)) ** 3 === n;
}
