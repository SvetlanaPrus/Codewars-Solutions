My granny has several cats. Most of them are wicked, some are normal and some of them are the likes of ^(~_~)^ aka holy cats. 
So my granny asked me to separate the holy cats from the rest of the crew. 
But I don't know how to do it. Can you help me separate the holy cats from the rest? 
In case there are no holy cats in the group, return an empty array.

//var input = ['wicked','normal',`^(~_~)^`,`"(^_^)"`,`*(^_^)*`]
//Test.assertDeepEquals(holycats(input),[`^(~_~)^`,`"(^_^)"`,`*(^_^)*`])


************************************


function holycats(arr){
  return arr.filter( el => el !== 'wicked' && el !== 'normal');
}
